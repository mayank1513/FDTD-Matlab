# FDTD-Matlab

Please download all the files in one folder and run Band_Diagram_main.m, Band_Diagram_main1.m, Band_Diagram_main2.m to generate photonic bnd diagrams for different parameters. All figure and .mat files are generated and stored in systematic directories.

You can modifiy Band_Diagram_main.m file to obtained desired results.
